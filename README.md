# Vault

This is an original password management tool to generate and store robust passwords.
You simply type a service name and an account ID and it will generate a password for you.
Alternatively, if you have your own password you can also store it as it is.

## HOW TO USE
1. Clone or download the repo and navigate to that directory
2. Setup environmetal variables below:
  - `MASTER_PW (required)`: The master password that is required at launch
  - `PW_LENGTH (optional)`: Length of passwords generated by this software (Default is 50 letters long)
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `node app.js`


## ENABLE TWO FACTOR AUTHENTICATION (2FA)
It is a highly effective security measure. Once you enable 2FA, you will have to enter a one-time password along with your normal password.
### HOW TO ENABLE 2FA
1. Run `node two_factor_auth.js`
2. Jot down the ascii value of the output.
  ```javascript
  {
    ascii: 'GA,?3VNCe^Ff&Ip*VXF38&/x<GJm?,Z[',
    hex: '47412c3f33564e43655e46662649702a5658463338262f783c474a6d3f2c5a5b',
    base32: 'I5ASYPZTKZHEGZK6IZTCMSLQFJLFQRRTHATC66B4I5FG2PZMLJNQ',
    otpauth_url: 'otpauth://totp/Vault?secret=I5ASYPZTKZHEGZK6IZTCMSLQFJLFQRRTHATC66B4I5FG2PZMLJNQ'
  }
  ```
3. Scan the QR code
- Downlaod either Microsoft Authenticator or Google Authenticator on your smartphone
- Scan the QR code in your terminal
4. Set Environmental variables
5. You are all set! From the next time you run `node app.js`, you are going to be prompted to enter 2FA.

### TODOs
- Master password encryption with sha-512
- Passwords encryption with RSA keys
- Deploy to a online server (really necessary?)
- Require pw twice when they first create it
